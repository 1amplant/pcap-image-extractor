Pcap Image Extraction and Face Detection
This repo contains two Python scripts: recapper.py and detector.py.

recapper.py extracts images from pcap files containing HTTP traffic.
detector.py detects and highlights faces in those images.

Usage:
Run recapper.py to extract images:
python recapper.py <path_to_pcap_file>

Run detector.py to detect faces in the images:
python detector.py
